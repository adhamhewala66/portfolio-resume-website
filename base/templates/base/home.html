                    <h4>My Firdt Job as a Developer</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>3 months after writting my first Hello World program on september 28th 2019 (while working in the
                    marketing department) i had convinced my boss to let me take a stab at building a better version of the
                    outdated laboratory management system my company was running on.</p>

                    <p>Before  i know it we transitioned from the old system and we're on to mine. My newibe self was now
                    in charge of hosting hundreds of thounds of lab samples and supporting thounds of clients.</p>

                    <p>From this you'll see that i'm someone that jumps before i can talk myself out of doing sdomething scary.
                    </p>

                    <p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece. I break the
                    code where I need to figure out why things work the way they do. Documentation is just a reference.</p>

                    <p>After almost two years of supporting my system at the lab I'm ready to learn something new. I'll
                    collaborating and sharing my experience with others on my blog (SayHelloWorld.co) & youtube channel.</p>
                    <p>Aside from building small projects I would love to enter a position where I can be part of a bigger team &
                    learn from others with more experience than myself.</p>
